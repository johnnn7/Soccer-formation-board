# Soccer-formation-board
An interactive formation board with draggable button-like object to signify player positions.


    There are 11 round buttons that are numbered.
        these represent the 11 playres needed for each team.
Purpose:
    on the sideline, this can be used to quickly drag and directly show a player the movements they are expected to to. rather than doing it on a whiteboard.

This is more for visual learners and i believe would help a team significantly.
